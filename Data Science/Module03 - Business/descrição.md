## Topic : How should companies get started in Data Science ##
 At the end of the day, for businesses, they know one thing, that if they are unable to measure something, they are unable to improve it. And if they are unable to measure their costs, they are unable to reduce them. 
 If they are unable to measure their profits, they are unable to increase them. So the first thing a company has to do is to start recording information, start capturing data. Data about costs, data about.. and then differentiated by labor costs and material costs.
 The cost to, how much it costs to sell one product and the total cost. And then you look at the revenue. Where is your revenue coming from? Is 80% of your revenue coming from 20% of your customers? Or is it the other way around?
 So first thing first, start capturing data. Once you have data, then you can apply algorithms and analytics to it. So the first thing to do would be to capture data. 
 If you're not capturing it, start capturing it. If you're capturing it, archive it. Do not overwrite on your old data thinking you don't need it anymore. Data never gets old, data is always relevant. Even if it's a hundred years old, 200 years old, it is relevant to you and your firm and your success.
 So keep data, capture it, archive it. Make sure nothing goes to waste. Make sure there's a consistency so someone 20 years later trying to understand that data should be able to do so.
 So have proper documentation. Do it now, put the best practices for data archiving in place the moment you start a business. And if you're already in business and you haven't done it, do it now.
 Start measuring things; Too many companies haven't measured things properly for a decade and then they decide they want data science. Data science inside a company is only going to be as valuable as the data collected. Garbage in, garbage out is a rule in any sort of analysis.
 If something is not measured, it's very difficult to improve it or to change it. So the very first step is measurement. If companies have existing data, then they should start looking at it and cleaning it. If they don't have existing data, then they need to start collecting it.
 I think to look for a team who love to work as a data scientist. The first step is to have employees, that they are interested in science. Cause if you don't have interest in your company, you will not have like engagement.
 Companies should remember that it's key to have a team, so it's not one data scientist but a team of them, that each of them have strengths in different areas of data science.

 A mensuração é o ponto de partida para a melhoria contínua nas organizações. Empresas que não registram e acompanham seus custos, receitas e processos têm dificuldade em reduzir despesas, aumentar lucros e tomar decisões estratégicas. Por isso, a primeira etapa para qualquer iniciativa orientada a dados é a coleta sistemática de informações, permitindo compreender como os recursos são utilizados e de onde vêm os resultados financeiros.
 Além da coleta, é fundamental armazenar e preservar os dados ao longo do tempo. Dados históricos não perdem relevância e podem fornecer insights valiosos sobre padrões, tendências e comportamentos, desde que sejam mantidos de forma organizada e bem documentada. A consistência e a qualidade dessas informações garantem que análises futuras sejam confiáveis e úteis para a organização.
 A análise e a ciência de dados só geram valor quando se baseiam em dados limpos e bem estruturados, pois resultados imprecisos comprometem a tomada de decisão. Nesse contexto, o uso de dados também depende de pessoas e cultura organizacional. A formação de equipes multidisciplinares, com profissionais interessados e capacitados, é essencial para transformar dados em conhecimento e apoiar decisões estratégicas de forma sustentável.


## Topic : Recruiting for Data Science ##
 When the companies are hiring people for a data science team, maybe a data scientist or an analyst, or a chief data scientist, the tendency would be to find the person who has all the skills, that they know the domain specific knowledge, they are excellent in analyzing structured and unstructured data, and they are great at presenting, and they've got great storytelling skills. So if you'll put all this together, you will realize you're looking for a unicorn, and your odds of finding a unicorn are pretty rare. I think what you need to do is to see, given the pool of applicants you have, who has the most resonance with your firm's DNA.
 Because, see, you can teach analytic skills. Anyone can learn analytic skills if they would dedicate time and effort to it. But what really matters is who is passionate about the kind of business that you do. Someone could be a great data scientist in the retail environment, but they may not be that exited about working in IT-related firms, or working with gigabytes of web logs.
 But if someone is excited about those web logs, or someone is excited about health-related data, then they would be able to contribute to your productivity much more so. And I would say if I'm looking for someone, if I have to put together a data science team, I would first look for curiosity. Is that person curious about things? Not just for data science, but anything. Are they curious about why this room is painted a certain way? Why the bookshelves have books and what kind of books?
 They have to have a certain degree of curiosity about everything that is in their vision that they look at. The second thing is, do they have a sense of humor? Because you see, you have to have lighthearted about it. If someone is too serious about it, they probably would take it too seriously, and would not be able to look at the lighter elements. 
 The third thing I think, and I think the last that I would look for, if I have to have a hierarchy, the last thing I would look for are technical skills. I would go through these social skills, curiosity, sense of humor, the ability to tell a story, the ability to know that there is a story there. And then once all is there, then I will say, "Well, can you do the technical side of it?" And if there is some hope or some sign of some technical skills, I would take them because I can train them in whatever skills they need.
 But I cannot teach curiosity. I cannot teach storytelling. I cannot certainly instill sense of humor in anyone. I think there's no hard and fast rule for hiring data scientists.
 I think it's gonna be a case by case thing. I would say there has to be some sort of technical component. Somebody should be able to manipulate the data. They should be able to communicate what they find in the data. I find quite often, nobody really cares about the R squared or confidence interval. So you have to be able to introduce those things
 and explain something in a compelling way.
 And they also have to find somebody who is relatable, because data science, it being typically new means that the person in that role has to make relationships and they have to work across different departments. If this data scientist has a good mathematics and statistic background. They have to consider problem solving abilities and analysis. 
 A data scientist needs to be good in analyzing problems. The persons they are hiring, they should love to play with data, and then they know how to play with the data visualization.
 They have analytical thinking. When a company is hiring, anyone to work on a data science team, they need to think about what role that person is going to take. Before a company begins, they need to understand what they want out of their data science team. 
 And then they need to hire to begin it. As they grow a data science team, they need to understand whether they need engineers, architects, designers to work on visualization, or whether they just need more people who can multiply large matrices. From a skills point, let's focus on the technical skills, and in that case, first thing would be what kind of technical platform would you like to adopt. Let's say you wanna work in a structured data environment, and let's say you wanna work in market research. Then the type of skills you need are slightly different than someone who would like to work in big data environments.
 If you wanna work in the traditional market research structured data environment, your skills should be some statistical knowledge, some knowledge of basic statistical algorithms,
 maybe some machine learning algorithms, and these are the tools that you would like to develop. If you wanna work in big data, then there's the other aspect of it, and that is to be able to store data. So you start with the expertise in storing large amounts of data, and then you look into platforms that allow you to do that.
 The next step would be able to manipulate large amounts of data, and the final step would be to apply algorithms to those large sets of data. So it's a three-step process, but most likely it starts. Most importantly, it starts with where you would like to be, in what field, in what domain. So, in terms of platforms, let's say you wanna be in a traditional
 predictive analytics environment, and you're not working with big data, then R, or Stata, or Python would be your tools.
 If you're working mostly with unstructured data, then Python is more suitable than R. If you're working with big data, then Hadoop and Spark are the environments that you will be working with. So it all depends upon where you would like to be, and what kind of work excites you, and then you pick your tools. In additional to technical skills, the second aspect of the data science is to have the ability communicate, the communication skills or presentation skills. I call them storytelling skills.
 That is that you have your analysis done, now can you tell a great story from it? If you have a very large table, can you synthesize this and make it more appealing that when it goes on the screen, or is it part of document that it just speaks, it sings the findings, and the reader just gets it right there? So, the ability to present your findings,
 either verbally, or in a presentation, or in a document, so that communication and presentation skills are equally important as the technical skills are.
 When you have a great insight, and when you're presenting your results...Imagine you're driving on a mountain and then there's a sharp turn, and you can't see what's beyond the turn, and then you make that turn, and then suddenly you see a tremendous valley in front of you, and this great sense of awe that, "I didn't know that." Right?
 So when you present your findings and you have this great finding, and you communicate it well, this is what people feel because they were not expecting it. They were not aware of it, and then this great sense of happiness that, "Now I know. And I didn't notice. Now I know." And then it empowers them. It gives them ideas what they can do with this knowledge,
 this new insight. It's a great sense of joy. As a data scientist, you're able to share it with your clients because you enabled it.
 
### _Description : Recruiting for Data Science_ ###
 Ao formar equipes de ciência de dados, as empresas frequentemente buscam profissionais que reúnam, ao mesmo tempo, domínio técnico, conhecimento do negócio, capacidade analítica e habilidades de comunicação. No entanto, esse perfil completo é raro, o que torna mais eficaz priorizar candidatos que apresentem maior alinhamento com a cultura e o propósito da organização, em vez de procurar um profissional que reúna todas as competências possíveis.
 O texto enfatiza que habilidades técnicas podem ser desenvolvidas por meio de treinamento, enquanto características como curiosidade, interesse genuíno pelo domínio de atuação e capacidade de contar histórias não podem ser facilmente ensinadas. Profissionais que demonstram entusiasmo pelo tipo de dado e pelo contexto do negócio tendem a gerar mais valor, pois se envolvem de forma mais profunda com os problemas analisados.
 Além disso, destaca-se a importância das habilidades de comunicação e storytelling, já que a análise de dados só se torna relevante quando seus resultados são apresentados de forma clara e impactante. A capacidade de transformar análises complexas em narrativas compreensíveis permite que gestores entendam os insights gerados e se sintam capacitados a tomar decisões baseadas em dados.
 Por fim, o texto reforça que não há um modelo único para a contratação de profissionais de dados. Cada organização deve definir suas necessidades e montar equipes com diferentes perfis, equilibrando competências técnicas, analíticas e humanas, de modo a transformar dados em conhecimento e impacto organizacional.

## Material - **The Final Deliverable** ##
 O tópico aborda como transformar análises em decisões estratégicas através da comunicação eficaz.

 - Material : [Final Deliverable - BigDataUniversity](Final%20Deliverable%20-%20BigDataUniversity.pdf)

    > **Propósito da Análise** : O objetivo máximo da análise de dados é comunicar descobertas para influenciar políticas ou estratégias.

    > **A arte da Narrativa** : Cientistas de dados não devem apenas apresentar tabelas e gráficos; eles devem construir uma narrativa que conecte esses pontos.

    > **Formatos e Contextos** : Foca em ensaios e relatórios extensos, geralmente entre 1.000 e 7.000 palavras

    > **Planejamento Reverso** : O documento recomenda planejar o entregável antes de começar a análise, garantindo que a mensagem e os dados estejam perfeitamente alinhados.
