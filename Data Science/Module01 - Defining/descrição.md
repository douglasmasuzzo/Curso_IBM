## Topic : _What is Data Science?_ ##
 Data science is a process, not an event. It is the process of using data to understand different things, to understand the world. For me, it's when you have a model, or a hypothesis of a problem, and you try to validate that hypothesis or model with your data.
 Data science is the art of uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind data. It's when you translate data into a story, so you use the storytelling to generate insights. And with these insights, you can make strategic... choices for a company or institution.
 Data science is a field about processes and systems, to extract data from various forms, whether it is an unstructured or structured form. Data science is the study of data, like biological sciences are the study of biology; physical sciences, it's the study of physical reactions. Data is real, data has real properties, and we need to study them, if we're gonna work on them.
 Data science involves data and some science. The definition, or the name, came up in the 80s and 90s when some professors were looking into the statistics curriculum, and they thought it would be better to call it data science. 
 But what is data science? I see data science as one's attempt to work with data to find answers to questions that they are exploring. In a nutshell, it's more about data than it is about science. If you have data, and you have curiosity, and you're working with data, and you're manipulating it, you're exploring it, the very exercise of going through analyzing data, trying to get some answers from it, is data science.
 Data science is relevant today because we have tons of data available. We used to worry about lack of data; now we have a data deluge. In the past, we didn't have algorithms; now we have algorithms. In the past, the software was expensive;
 now it's open source and free. In the past, we couldn't store large amounts of data; now, for a fraction of the cost, we can have gazillions of data sets for very low costs, so the tools to work with data, the very availability of data,
 and the ability to store and analyze data, it's all cheap, it's all available,
 it's all ubiquitous, it's here. There's never been a better time to be a data scientist.

## Topic : _There are many paths to Data Science_ ##
 Data science didn't really exist when I was growing up. It's not something that I ever woke up and said, "I want to be a data scientist when I grow up." No, it didn't exist. I didn't know I would be working in data science. When I grew up there wasn't that field called data science. And I think it's really new.
 Data science didn't exist until 2009, 2011. Someone like DJ Patil or Andrew Gelman coined the term. Before that there was statistics and I didn't want to be any of those. I wanted to be in business and then I found data science a heck of a lot more interesting. 
 I studied statistics, that's how I started. I went through many different stages in my life where I wanted to be a singer and then a doctor and then I realized
 that I was good at math. So I chose an area that was focusing quantitative analysis and from then, I do think that I wanted to work with data not necessarily, data science as it's known today.
 The first time that I had contact with data science, was when I was in my first year of mechanical engineering. Strategical consulting firms, they use data science to make decisions. So, that was my first contact with data science. I had a complicated problem that I needed solved. The usual techniques that we had at the time couldn't help with the problem. I graduated with a math degree in the worst possible time right after the economic crisis. You actually had to be useful to get a job. So I went and got a degree in statistics and then I worked enough jobs that were called data scientist that I suddenly became one.
 My undergraduate degree was in business and I majored in politics, philosophy and economics. And then I did a Masters in Business Analytics at New York University at the Stern School of Business. When I left my undergrad, the first company I joined, it turned out that they were analyzing electronic point of sale data for retail manufacturers. And what we were doing was data science but we only really started using that term much later.
 In fact, I would say, four or five years ago is when we started calling it analytics and data science. I had several options for my internship here in Canada and one of the options was to work with data science. I used to work in product development but I think that was a good choice. And then I started my internship with data science.
 I'm a civil engineer by training, so all engineers work with data. I would say the conventional use of data science in my life started with transportation research. I started building large models trying to forecast traffic on streets, trying to determine congestion and greenhouse gas emissions or tailpipe emissions.
 I think that's where my start was and I started building these models when I was a graduate student at the University of Toronto. I started working with very large data sets looking at household samples of 150,000 households, half a million trips and that too, I'm speaking from mid-nineties, when this was supposed to be a very large data set but not in today's terms but that's how I started. I continued working with it and then I moved to McGill University where I was a professor of transportation engineering and I built even bigger data models that involved data and analytics. So I would say, yes transportation research brought me to data science.

 Inicialmente, a área de Ciência de Dados não tinha esta nomenclatura, apesar de possuir a mesma estrutura e definição, o campo relacionado a coleta, extração e manipulação de dados era entitulado como "Estatística". O estudo compõe meio didático semelhante ao conteúdo de aprendizagem de Engenharia, composto por fundamentos aritméticos e estratégico. Por abranger fundamentos presentes em diversas ramificações de Engenharia, o campo de estudo possibilita a ágil transição entre diferentes áreas de atuação, exigindo domínio sob aspectos 
 aritméticos e recursos analíticos.

## Topic : _Any advice for new Data Scientist_ ## 
 My advice to an aspiring data scientist is to be curious, extremely argumentative, judgmental. Curiosity is absolutely must. If you're not curious, you would not know what to do with the data.
 Judgmental because if you do not have preconceived notions about things, you wouldn't know where to begin. Argumentative because if you can argue
 then you can plead a case, at least you can start somewhere. And then you learn from data and then you modify your assumptions and hypothesis, and your data would help you learn.
 And you may start at the wrong point, you may say that I thought I believed this
 but now with data I know this, so this allows you a learning process. So curiosity, being able to take a position, strong position, and then moving forward with it. 
 The other thing that a data scientist would need is some comfort and flexibility with analytics platforms. Some software, some computing platform but that's secondary. The most important thing is curiosity and the ability to take positions.
 Once you have done that, once you've analyzed, then you've got some answers. And that's the last thing that a data scientist needs and that is the ability to tell a story. That once you have your analytics, once you have your tabulations,
 now you should be able to tell a great story from it. Because if you don't tell a great story from it, your findings will remain hidden, it will remain buried, nobody would know, but your rise to prominence is pretty much relying on your ability to tell great stories.
 A starting point would be to see what is your competitive advantage? Do you want to be a data scientist in any field or a specific field because let's say you want to be a data scientist and work for an IT firm or a web-based or internet-based firm. Then you need a different set of skills. And if you want to be a data scientist for let's say in the health industry, then you need different sets of skills. So figure out first what your interest is and what is your competitive advantage.
 Your competitive advantage is not necessarily going to be your analytical skills. Your competitive advantage is your understanding of some aspect of life where you exceed beyond others in understanding that. Maybe it's film, maybe it's retail, maybe it's health, maybe it's computers.
 Once you have figured out where your expertise lies, then you start acquiring analytical skills, what platforms to learn. And those platforms, those tools would be specific to the industry that you're interested in. And then once you have got some proficiency in the tools, the next thing would be to apply your skills to real problems and then tell rest of the world what you can do with it.

## Topic : _What is the Cloud?_ ##
 Our industry is in the process of constant change and reinvention. Since this video was recorded, a few things have changed. For example, the learning tool we used to call Data Scientist Workbench now has a new name. It is called Skills Network Labs or SN Labs for short. It is much more functional, faster and a lot easier to use yet it preserves the key attributes that made it so popular with learners. There is nothing to download, install or configure. All you need is your web browser. There is nothing to reserve and there is no limit on time. Any files you create, will remain on SN Labs. You can continue to use SN Labs even after you have completed your course. And yes, it is still available free of charge to our learners. So, remember, when you hear Data Scientist Workbench, think Skills Network Labs. Now, go ahead and watch the video lesson.


 Cloud is a, it's a godsend for data scientists. Primarily because you're able to take the, or you take your data, take your information and put it in the cloud, put it in the central storage system. It allows you to bypass the physical limitations of the computers and the systems you're using and it allows you to deploy the analytics and storage capacities of advanced machines that do not necessarily have to be your machine or your company's machine.
 Cloud allows you not just to store large amounts of data on servers somewhere in California or in Nevada, but it also allows you to deploy very advanced computing algorithms and the ability to do high performance computing
 using machines that are not yours. So, think of it as you have some information, you can't store it, so you send it to storage space, let's call it cloud, and the algorithms that you need to use you don't have them with you, but then on the cloud you have those algorithms available.
 So, what you do, is you deploy those algorithms on very large data sets and you're able to do it even though your own systems, your own machines, your own computing environments were not allowing you to do so. So, cloud is beautiful.  And, the other thing that cloud is beautiful for is that it allows multiple entities to work with same data at the same time.
 So, you can be working with the same data that your colleagues in, say, Germany,
 and another team in India, and another team in Ghana, they are collectively working and they are able to do so because the information and the algorithms and the tools and the answers and the results, whatever they needed is available at a central place. Which we call cloud, so cloud is beautiful.
 At the Big Data University which is an IBM initiative, we have these courses people can take and learn about data science, but at the same time we provide this cloud based environment for not only analytics, but also for working with big and small data. So one of the products that is integrated with Big Data University is Data Scientist Workbench. 
 Data Scientist Workbench is an internet based solution, you log in and the moment you log in, you now have access to some very advanced computing environment. As simple as R and Rstudio and data and algorithms to define the data set using OpenRefine, but also the ability to work with very large data sets using technologies like Spark. 
 So, the advantage of working with Data Scientist Workbench is not only that you have the ability to work with these advanced algorithms and two computing platforms, but you also have the ability to work with very large data sets because Spark is integrated and it's all in the cloud, you don't have to maintain it, you don't have to download it, you don't have to worry about updating it. All is being done for you in the cloud by the Data Scientist Workbench.

### _Descrição : What is the Cloud?_ ###
